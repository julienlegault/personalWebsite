# Personal Website

This is my personal website where I gather tools I have developed to make my life easier/more fun. 

Each of the individual pages has it's own repository in my github, but at some point that will be changed. 

# Pages

Home Page (index.html): Contains the navigation menu, an image of me along with a short description. Also has my github commit history and my twitter feed, along with links to both github and twitter.

Lights (lights.html): Contains a form to pick a color and when the form is posted it changes the color of the lights in my room.

Dates (dates.html): Selects a random romantic date based on location, price, if it's outside or if it's food. Then the date location is plotted on a map. The dates are stored in a SQLite database. 

# TODO

DateAPI improvements allowing users to add dates.

Login page with users.

Move to Bootstrap for a better looking page. 

Combine all repositories of seperate techs. 

Add Generic Bingo
